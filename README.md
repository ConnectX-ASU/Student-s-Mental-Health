# Student-s-Mental-Health

Have you ever felt overwhelmed by school, friends, and life in college? From tough classes to social events and worries about the future, it's a lot to handle!


The project goal was clear: identify stress and mental health issues among university students to raise awareness and provide essential support.
Here's how we tackled it:

* Data Collection: We gathered datasets from various platforms and integrated real-time responses from university students to enrich our dataset.

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Deep dive into patterns provided invaluable insights into student behaviors and mental health indicators.

* Data Preprocessing: Ensured data integrity by meticulously cleaning and preprocessing the dataset, eliminating errors and missing data.

* Clustering and Classification: Employed clustering techniques to categorize students based on their mental health scores and issues. Leveraged classification models to predict new students' mental health categories.

* Technological Tools: Utilized Python and libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. Kaggle and real-time survey platforms facilitated data collection.

* Model Deployment: Our user-friendly form allows students to input their mental health scores, providing personalized support suggestions based on their category.

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in addressing real-world challenges and promoting mental health awareness. Moving forward, we're committed to refining our model and expanding its reach to benefit more students across universities.
